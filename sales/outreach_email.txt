Subject: Heatmap → STEP branching cold plate (2 free designs)

Hi {{name}},

I built a tool that turns a cold‑plate heat map into a manufacturable branching supply/return network and exports STEP/STL/DXF.

It uses surface-optimized junction rules (Nature minimal-surface framework) so branches morph between:
- orthogonal sprouts for thin branches
- more symmetric branching when thickness increases

If you send:
- plate outline (DXF) or dimensions
- a heat map (CSV or image)
- inlet/outlet positions + channel constraints

…I’ll generate **2 candidate plates free** and send you the STEP + a ΔP/uniformity report.

Worth a quick 15 minutes this week?
