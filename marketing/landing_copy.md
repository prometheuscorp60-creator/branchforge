## Headline
Generate branching cold‑plate channels automatically. Export STEP.

## Subhead
BranchForge converts heat maps into manufacturable branching networks with surface‑optimized junction geometry inspired by Nature’s 3D surface‑minimization framework.

## Bullets
- Heat map → branching supply/return manifolds in minutes
- Manufacturing constraints (CNC / AM / etched lid presets)
- ΔP + temperature uniformity preview (reduced‑order model)
- Export STEP/STL/DXF and validate in your existing CFD workflow

## CTA
Upload a heat map → get a STEP file.
